# EthereumBalance

EthereumBalance is a Java utility for retrieving real-time Ethereum wallet balances. It provides a simple way to integrate balance querying functionality into Java applications or services.

## Features

- Fetch Ethereum wallet balances in real-time.
- Utilizes the Web3j library for seamless integration.
- Supports retrieval of balances from the Ethereum mainnet via the Infura API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ethereum-balance.git
```

2. Import the project into your preferred Java development environment.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed (Web3j library).

## Usage

1. Import the `EthereumBalance` class into your Java project.

2. Call the `getBalance()` method, providing the Ethereum wallet address as an argument.

3. Receive the wallet balance in Ether (ETH) as a `BigDecimal` object.

```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
import EthereumBalance;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String address = "0xYourAddress";
        try {
            BigDecimal balance = EthereumBalance.getBalance(address);
            System.out.println("Balance: " + balance + " ETH");
        } catch (ExecutionException | InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
